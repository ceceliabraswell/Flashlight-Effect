    <!-- <p>One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewellery store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back, holding out his hand.</p>
    <p>“What&#39s the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?”</p>
    <p>“Yes. You know what I think of you.”</p>
    <p>“You&#39re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly. “Crazy as hell. I don&#39t know what&#39s the matter with you.”</p>
    <p>“Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?”</p>
    <p>He stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours. I started to turn away, but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm.</p>
    <p>“I told him the truth,” he said. “He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren&#39t in he tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn&#39t told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house—” He broke off defiantly. “What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy&#39s, but he was a tough one. He ran over Myrtle like you&#39d run over a dog and never even stopped his car.”</p> -->
    <p>There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn&#39t true.</p>
    <p>“And if you think I didn&#39t have my share of suffering—look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it was awful—”</p>
    <p>I couldn&#39t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made…</p>
    <p>I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewellery store to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Gatsby&#39s house was still empty when I left—the grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own. I didn&#39t want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train.</p>
    <p>I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden, and the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn&#39t investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn&#39t know that the party was over.</p>
    <p>On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand.</p>
    <p>Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors&#39 eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby&#39s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.</p>
    <p>And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby&#39s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy&#39s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.</p>
    <p>Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that&#39s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further… And one fine morning—</p>
    <p>So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.</p>
